# MMB-117 Environmental Microbiology course

This repository contains all the materials (except data) for the amplicon sequence analysis part of the course.  
We will run the data analysis steps using Jupyter notebooks and R markdown files in RStudio.

To make things easy and skip all installations, all the computing will be done at CSC and we will use their web interface to connect to Puhti supercomputer, a high performance computing (HPC) cluster.  

To be able to access Puhti and do the exercises, you need a CSC account and need to be added to the course project. Instructions have been sent by mail and/or in Moodle.  

This repository will be copied to Puhti when you launch the "Jupyter for courses" for the first time. So you will have all the materials in your working directory when you start.
